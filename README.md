**InternLM-XComposer** is a vision-language large model (VLLM) based on [InternLM](https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM/tree/main) for advanced text-image comprehension and composition. InternLM-XComposer has several appealing properties:

- **Interleaved Text-Image Composition**: InternLM-XComposer can effortlessly generate coherent and contextual articles that seamlessly integrate images, providing a more engaging and immersive reading experience. The interleaved text-image composition is implemented in following steps:

    1. **Text Generation**: It crafts long-form text based on human-provided instructions.
    2. **Image Spoting and Captioning**: It pinpoints optimal locations for image placement and furnishes image descriptions.
    3. **Image Retrieval and Selection**: It select image candidates and identify the image that optimally complements the content.

- **Comprehension with Rich Multilingual Knowledge**: The text-image comprehension is empowered by training on extensive multi-modal multilingual concepts with carefully crafted strategies, resulting in a deep understanding of visual content.
- **Strong performance**: It consistently achieves state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks for vision-language large models, including [MME Benchmark](https://github.com/BradyFU/Awesome-Multimodal-Large-Language-Models/tree/Evaluation) (English), [MMBench](https://opencompass.org.cn/leaderboard-multimodal) (English), [Seed-Bench](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AILab-CVC/SEED-Bench_Leaderboard) (English), [MMBench-CN](https://opencompass.org.cn/leaderboard-multimodal)(Chinese), and [CCBench](https://opencompass.org.cn/leaderboard-multimodal)(Chinese).

We release InternLM-XComposer series in two versions:

- [InternLM-XComposer-VL-7B](https://huggingface.co/internlm/internlm-xcomposer-vl-7b): The pretrained and multi-task trained VLLM model with InternLM as the initialization of the LLM, achieving strong performance on various multimodal benchmarks, e.g., MME Benchmark, MMBench Seed-Bench, CCBench, and MMBench-CN.
- [InternLM-XComposer-7B](https://huggingface.co/internlm/internlm-xcomposer-7b): The further instruction tuned VLLM for *Interleaved Text-Image Composition* and *LLM-based AI assistant*.

## Evaluation

We evaluate InternLM-XComposer-VL on five multimodal benchmarks: [MME Benchmark](https://github.com/BradyFU/Awesome-Multimodal-Large-Language-Models/tree/Evaluation), [MMBench](https://opencompass.org.cn/leaderboard-multimodal), [Seed-Bench](https://huggingface.co/spaces/AILab-CVC/SEED-Bench_Leaderboard) in the English language, [CCBench](https://opencompass.org.cn/leaderboard-multimodal), [MMBench-CN](https://opencompass.org.cn/leaderboard-multimodal) in the simplified chinese language.

   - [MME Benchmark](https://github.com/BradyFU/Awesome-Multimodal-Large-Language-Models/tree/Evaluation): A comprehensive evaluation benchmark for multimodal large language models with 14 subtasks.
   - [MMBench](https://opencompass.org.cn/leaderboard-multimodal): A comprehensive evaluation pipeline comprised of meticulously curated multimodal dataset and a novel circulareval strategy using ChatGPT.
   - [MMBench-CN](https://opencompass.org.cn/leaderboard-multimodal): A simplified chinese language version of [MMBench](https://opencompass.org.cn/leaderboard-multimodal).

Please refer to the [installation instructions](docs/install.md)

## Quickstart

We provide a simple example to show how to use InternLM-XComposer with ü§ó Transformers.

#### ü§ó Transformers

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

torch.set_grad_enabled(False)

# init model and tokenizer
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('internlm/internlm-xcomposer-7b', trust_remote_code=True).cuda().eval()
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('internlm/internlm-xcomposer-7b', trust_remote_code=True)
model.tokenizer = tokenizer

# example image
image = 'examples/images/aiyinsitan.jpg'

# Single-Turn Pure-Text Dialogue
text = 'Please introduce Einstein.'
response = model.generate(text)
print(response)
# 'Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist. He developed the general theory of relativity, 
# one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence 
# on the philosophy of science. In 1921, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to 
# theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.'


# Single-Turn Text-Image Dialogue
text = 'Please introduce the person in this picture in detail.'
image = 'examples/images/aiyinsitan.jpg'
response = model.generate(text, image)
print(response)
# 'The person in the picture is Albert Einstein, a renowned theoretical physicist and one of the most influential 
# scientists of the 20th century. He was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, and died on April 18, 1955, 
# in Princeton, New Jersey.'


# Multi-Turn Text-Image Dialogue
# 1st turn
text = 'Who is in the picture?'
response, history = model.chat(text=text, image=image, history=None)
print(response)
# 'Albert Einstein is in the picture.'

# 2nd turn
text = 'What are his achievements?'
response, history = model.chat(text=text, image=None, history=history)
print(response)
# 'Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the general theory of relativity, 
# one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). He is best known for his mass‚Äìenergy 
# equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation"), and his explanation of 
# the photoelectric effect, both of which are examples of his special and general theories of relativity.'

# 3rd turn
text = 'Is he the greatest physicist?'
response, history = model.chat(text=text, image=None, history=history)
print(response)
# 'Yes, Albert Einstein is widely regarded as one of the greatest physicists of all time'
