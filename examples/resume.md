# Short Biography

Qidong Huang is a PhD student at University of Science and Technology of China. He has published more than 7 papers at top1-tier conferences and journals, such as CVPR/ICCV/AAAI/TIP/TCSVT. His research interests focus on vision transfer learning (e.g., prompt learning for vision pretrained models) and artificial intelligence security (e.g., adversarial examples and anti-DeepFake). He is the reviewer of many top conferences (including CVPR, ICCV, ECCV) and top journals (TNNLS, PR).

# Skills

- Expertise in vision prompt learning: I have been researching the prompt learning for large-scale vision pretrained models and published one paper on top-tier computer vision conferences, in which I propose DAM-VP, a data diversity-aware method for efficient and adaptive vision prompt learning. This work alleviates the mismatch between vision prompts and downstream data diversity.
- Expertise in artificial intelligence security: I have been studying artificial intelligence security since 2020, including adversarial attack&defense and anti-DeepFake. For adversarial attack, I propose SI-Adv, a shape-invariant attack for 3D point cloud recognition which great boosts the imperceptibility of adversarial examples. For adversarial defense, I propose a contrastive adversarial training framework for robust point cloud recognition named PointCAT. Besides, our work for improving adversarial robustness of masked autoencoders has been recently accepted by ICCV 2023. For anti-DeepFake, we are the first to propose the concept of “initiative defense” against DeepFakes by proactively protecting users’ facial privacy before the manipulation, unlike previous ex-post countermeasures like DeepFake detection.
