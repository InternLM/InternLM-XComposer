**InternLM-XComposer2** is a groundbreaking vision-language large model (VLLM) based on [InternLM2-7B](https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM/tree/main) excelling in free-form text-image composition and comprehension. It boasts several amazing capabilities and applications:

- **Free-form Interleaved Text-Image Composition**: InternLM-XComposer2 can effortlessly generate coherent and contextual articles with interleaved images following diverse inputs like outlines, detailed text requirements and reference images, enabling highly customizable content creation.

- **Accurate Vision-language Problem-solving**: InternLM-XComposer2 accurately handles diverse and challenging vision-language Q&A tasks based on free-form instructions, excelling in recognition, perception, detailed captioning, visual reasoning, and more.

- **Awesome performance**: InternLM-XComposer2 based on InternLM2-7B not only significantly outperforms existing open-source multimodal models in 13 benchmarks but also **matches or even surpasses GPT-4V and Gemini Pro in 6 benchmarks**

We release InternLM-XComposer2 series in three versions:

- **InternLM-XComposer2-4KHD-7B** <a href="https://huggingface.co/internlm/internlm-xcomposer2-4khd-7b">🤗</a>: The high-resolution multi-task trained VLLM model with InternLM-7B as the initialization of the LLM for *High-resolution understanding*, *VL benchmarks* and *AI assistant*.

- **InternLM-XComposer2-VL-7B** <a href="https://huggingface.co/internlm/internlm-xcomposer2-vl-7b">🤗</a> : The multi-task trained VLLM model with InternLM-7B as the initialization of the LLM for *VL benchmarks* and *AI assistant*. **It ranks as the most powerful vision-language model based on 7B-parameter level LLMs, leading across 13 benchmarks.**

- **InternLM-XComposer2-VL-1.8B** <a href="https://huggingface.co/internlm/internlm-xcomposer2-vl-1_8b">🤗</a> : A lightweight version of InternLM-XComposer2-VL based on InternLM-1.8B.

- **InternLM-XComposer2-7B** <a href="https://huggingface.co/internlm/internlm-xcomposer2-7b">🤗</a>: The further instruction tuned VLLM for *Interleaved Text-Image Composition* with free-form inputs.

## Inference on Multiple GPUs

If you have multiple GPUs, but the memory size of each GPU is not enough to accommodate the entire model, you can split the model across multiple GPUs. First, install `accelerate` using the command: `pip install accelerate`. Then, execute the follows scripts for chat:

```
# chat with 2 GPUs
python examples/example_chat.py --num_gpus 2
```

## Inference Acceleration by LMDeploy

If InternLM-XComposer2 model inference optimization is required, we recommend using [LMDeploy](https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy).

In the following subsections, we will introduce the usage of LMDeploy with the [internlm-xcomposer2-4khd-7b](https://huggingface.co/internlm/internlm-xcomposer2-4khd-7b) model as an example. 

First of all, please install the pypi package with `pip install lmdeploy`. By default, it depends on CUDA 12.x. For a CUDA 11.x environment, please refer to the [installation guide](https://lmdeploy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started.html#installation).

### Offline Inference Pipeline

```python
from lmdeploy import pipeline
from lmdeploy.vl import load_image
pipe = pipeline('internlm/internlm-xcomposer2-4khd-7b')
image = load_image('examples/4khd_example.webp')
response = pipe(('describe this image', image))
print(response)
```
For more on using the VLM pipeline, including multi-image inference or multi-turn chat, please overview [this](https://lmdeploy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/inference/vl_pipeline.html) guide.

### Online Inference Service

LMDeploy supports one-click packaging of the InternLM-XComposer2 model into an OpenAI service, providing seamless integration with the OpenAI API.

The service can be launched by one command as below:
```shell
lmdeploy serve api_server internlm/internlm-xcomposer2-4khd-7b
```

The arguments of `api_server` can be viewed through the command `lmdeploy serve api_server -h`, for instance, `--tp` to set tensor parallelism, `--session-len` to specify the max length of the context window, `--cache-max-entry-count` to adjust the GPU mem ratio for k/v cache etc.

For more details, including service startup with docker, RESTful API information, and openai integration methods, please refer to [this](https://lmdeploy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/serving/api_server_vl.html) guide.

## 4-Bit Model

We provide 4-bit quantized models to ease the memory requirement of the models. To run the 4-bit models (GPU memory >= 12GB), you need first install the corresponding [dependency](./docs/install.md), then execute the follows scripts for chat:

  response, _ = model.chat(tokenizer, query=text, image=image, history=[], do_sample=False)
print(response)
#The image features a quote by Oscar Wilde, "Live life with no excuses, travel with no regrets."
#The quote is displayed in white text against a dark background. In the foreground, there are two silhouettes of people standing on a hill at sunset.
#They appear to be hiking or climbing, as one of them is holding a walking stick.
#The sky behind them is painted with hues of orange and purple, creating a beautiful contrast with the dark figures.
