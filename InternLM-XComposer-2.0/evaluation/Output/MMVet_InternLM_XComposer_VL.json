  "v1_0": " To find the value of x in the equation, we need to rearrange the equation and solve for x. The given equation is:\n\n(x + 3)^2 = 4\n\nFirst, let's expand the left side of the equation:\n\nx^2 + 6x + 9 = 4\n\nNow, let's subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx^2 + 6x + 9 - 4 = 4 - 4\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\nx^2 + 6x + 5 = 0\n\nNow, we have a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0. To solve for x, we can use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = 6, and c = 5. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nx = (-6 \u00b1 \u221a(6^2 - 4*1*5)) / (2*1)\n\nx = (-6 \u00b1 \u221a(36 - 20)) / 2\n\nx = (-6 \u00b1 \u221a16) / 2\n\nx = (-6 \u00b1 4) / 2\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions for x:\n\nx = (-6 + 4) / 2 = -2\n\nx = (-6 - 4) / 2 = -6\n\nSo, the two possible values for x in the equation (x + 3)^2 = 4 are x = -2 and x = -6.",
